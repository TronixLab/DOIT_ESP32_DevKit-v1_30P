# ESP-WROOM-32 (30P)

48 pins with different functions come with the ESP32 chip. However, not all pins are suitable for use in Devkit. There are also concerns about how to use the GPIOs for the ESP32. What pins are you going to use? What pins in your projects can you avoid using? The goal of this repo is to be a quick and easy reference guide for the ESP32 GPIOs to follow. If you're familiar with ESP8266, its successor is ESP32. ESP32 is a low-cost, low-power 32-bit dual-core microcontroller incorporates wireless WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities created by Espressif Systems.The ESP32 has developed a reputation as the ultimate chip or module for hobbyists and IoT developers, most frequently designed for handheld devices, wearable technology, and IoT applications.
